🚀 Agent Adventure: Grid-World Reinforcement Learning in Action

📍 Developed as part of my "Principles of Autonomy and Decision Making" course at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI).

I'm excited to share my latest project — a custom Reinforcement Learning environment and agent built from scratch using Python and OpenAI Gymnasium. This project showcases how an agent learns to make autonomous decisions, avoid obstacles, and navigate toward a goal in a 5×5 grid world.

🔧 Project Highlights:
• Designed a fully custom GridWorld environment with walls, a danger zone, and a fixed goal.
• Implemented a smart reward system that guides learning while penalizing wrong moves.
• Trained a Q-Learning agent with epsilon-greedy exploration and real-time feedback.
• Used matplotlib to render each step of the agent’s journey interactively.
• Visualized the learned Q-table for each action using heatmaps (seaborn).

📊 Results:
• The agent successfully learns safe, goal-oriented paths while avoiding dangerous or blocked tiles.
• Heatmaps clearly reflect how the agent values actions across the grid.

🧠 Tech Stack: Python, OpenAI Gymnasium, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
🎯 Core Concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Epsilon Decay, Reward Shaping, Autonomous Navigation

This hands-on project was a great opportunity to explore core autonomy and decision-making principles with visual, interpretable results.
